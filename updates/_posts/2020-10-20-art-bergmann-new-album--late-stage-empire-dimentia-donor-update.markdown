 Hello people:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi gracious donors to Art Bergmann's "Late Stage
Empire Dementia"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long wait is almost over.Album release is coming in the
early new year.A single from the album is being rushed out now w/video
to support all the peoples fighting fascism in the
streets."Christo-Fascists" features Russell Broom,Wayne Kramer,Ian
Grant and myself kickin' out the jams in 4 stuffed minutes of
Detroit-style art/noise .Danny Vacon of "the Dudes" came in to
accompany the "Anti-Dude" on some operatics.A glorious reminder of
what can be achieved when we put on our thinkin' caps with some
muscles;HAH!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All donors to the project will receive a digi copy of single
and cover-art which was stolen from apocalyptic painter Hieronymous
Bosch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video for the single will be created by Thor Henriksen,a
denizen of Halifax who generously donated his time and artistry to
this project.

broken and black heart.
