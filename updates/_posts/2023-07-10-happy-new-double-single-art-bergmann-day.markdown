FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: July 10, 2023
 
TORONTO ON -- Member of the Order of Canada, Juno Award winner, two-time Polaris Music Prize long listed artist... Art Bergmann has been honoured by his home country in a multitude of ways. But behind the accolades is still a man coping with the unforgiving realities of life as he enters his seventies.
 
ShadowWalk -- released Sept. 29 via (weewerk) -- is Bergmann’s ode to Sherri Decembrini, his beloved wife of 30 years who passed away unexpectedly in March 2022. The album’s 12 songs capture the darkness, grief and desolation that comes from such a soul crushing loss, while also offering genuine hope that life will go on.
 
For Art, music remains the strongest healing force, and today he offers a preview of ShadowWalk with two songs, "Raw Naked Monday" and "A Hymn For Us,"  that clearly demonstrate he hasn't lost any of his ability to match memorable melodies with deeply personal lyrics.
 
Recorded at Turtle Sound South Surrey and IDIO Studio in Surrey, BC, ShadowWalk is an album for everyone who has loved, lost, and continues to live. Many of the songs were co-written with B.C. poet Patricia Kay, while Art’s longtime friend and fellow songwriter Donna Kerbel penned one track. Produced by Russell Broom and Wes Smith, Broom also contributed much of the music and soundscapes for the album as well. 
 
Additional contributors to ShadowWalk include Paul Rigby (pedal steel), Aidan Farrell (vocals), Owen Owen Owen (bass), Adam Drake (drums), Sunny Matharu (tabla) and Katie Mosehauer & the Glass Heart String Orchestra (strings). The album has been mastered by Greg Reely and will be released on vinyl, as well as on all digital platforms. The album recording was supported by Creative BC and the Province of British Columbia. Special Thanks to all our generous GoFundMe donors for helping make this album possible. Utmost gratitude to Stephen Rioux, Jay Smales and (weewerk) for financing the vinyl pressing. All photography by P. Kay except back cover photo by Sherri.  All layouts and graphics by Art and Marc Floyd. Eternal gratitude to TeamArt members Colin Smith,  Jason Schneider, Gord Withers and Gordon Celesta. Executive Producer Phil Klygo (weewerk).
 
Now back in Vancouver, where in the late 1970s he was a driving force behind the city's punk rock scene, Bergmann will launch ShadowWalk with a show at The Rickshaw Theatre, on Friday Sept. 29. The night will also include a group discussion about his 2022 authorized biography, The Longest Suicide, with its author Jason Schneider along with moderator Aaron Chapman. Advance tickets: <https://an-evening-with-art-bergmann.eventbrite.ca>

Art will also have a Toronto release show at The Horseshoe Tavern on Thursday November 2nd.
 
"A Hymn For Us" is from Art's forthcoming full length album ShadowWalk on (weewerk) out September 29th
 
"I woke from a dream, or a dream awoke me with these words “Please, a hymn for all of us”  We fleshed it out into this universal plea. We will all face loss in our lives. This is for everyone who has loved, all who have lost and we, who live." – Art

<strong>LYRICS</strong>

Please, a hymn for all of us
 
We who live and who we lost
 
Who searched for love at life’s cost
 
Please, a hymn for all of us
 
May they live in Elysian fields
 
In blinding beauty that does not yield
 
Memory’s treasure we always feel
 
Roll away the stone that seals
 
In darkest night may you dream
 
Of wildling light that you seek
 
That glory sparks in every child
 
If built into a fire
 
Yea glory sparks in every child
 
Help them build a lasting fire
 
Of Love before they learn to lie
 
Give them Love that never dies
 
In Our Love’s a legacy
 
A legacy of Love (x2)
 
Place seeds of life in every gun
 
No, don’t flinch it must be done
 
Shoot them hard into the ground
 
Make growing joy the only sound
 
All creatures hear the sacred    psalm
 
As broken hearts sing all night long
 
The timeless plea: “Let kindness be
 
The future for you and me”
 
In our Love a legacy
 
A legacy of Love
 
Legacy of Love
 
 
Raw Naked Monday is from Art's forthcoming full length album Shadowwalk on (weewerk) out September 29th.
 
“A bit of humour and some respite found.” – Art

<strong>LYRICS</strong>
 
Its a raw naked Monday
 
Laid out, ripe in her room
 
She's declining all raiment
 
I'm unsealing my doom
 
On a raw naked Monday
 
Alllove on Monday
 
At your door
 
May I come in?
 
I'm raw nervy memory
 
Locked and fused in lover's lightning
 
I'm burning it off
 
Just like yesterday's skin
 
Raw naked Monday
 
Lies ripe in her room
 
Alllove on Monday
 
Laid out in a swoon
 
No longer a vision
 
No longer strange
 
We sleepin' fitful
 
We play Kama Sutra Supreme
 
Awaken from each way
 
Into happy smiling new dream
 
Its a secular service
 
We've got sanctified sin
 
So so sacred Monday
 
Jealous friends never get in
 
No longer a vision
 
No longer strange
 
Professin' confessin'
 
You know she sears like the sun
 
We make love incandescent
 
We live and love in Illumination
