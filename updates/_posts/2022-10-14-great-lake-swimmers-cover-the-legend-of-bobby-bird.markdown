Tony Dekker of Great Lake Swimmers had this to say about why he chose to cover this particular song, "Art Bergmann's recent work proves that he is more essential now than ever, adding a vital new link in the chain of an already incredible song-writing career. As a long-time fan, I continue to be stunned and believe he is currently making some of his best work, and this important song, "The Legend Of Bobby Bird" highlights that crucially.

To echo Art's words, "people should hear this song and they should just weep…and ask for forgiveness." 
Our version hopes to amplify that sentiment and help tell the story of Bobby Bird, adding to the voices calling for truth and reconciliation with Canada's First Nations, with a hope to learn and continue the healing process from the atrocities of the residential school system."

When asked what he thought of their cover effort, Art had this to say, "The Great Lake Swimmers have taken my song, "The Legend of Bobby Bird" and created something completely new. Tony Dekker's beautiful voice is mesmerizing. I am thankful. We are blessed by this version."

Art Bergmann was appointed to the Order Of Canada in 2020 for his "indelible contributions to the Canadian punk music scene, and for his thought-provoking discourse on social, gender and racial inequalities.” His biography, “The Longest Suicide” written by long time publicist Jason Schneider will be published by Anvil Press October 14.
