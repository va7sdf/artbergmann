“I thank Russell Broom for summoning up my request for sirenic beauty of old and Sherri for being that siren...double beauty was hatched. Greg Reely realized it.  
Naomi and Zoe must carry on and so must I.  
Thank you to Kenneth for the broodingly beautiful video he shot, Thor for the surreal video edit, and to Jason, Phil and TeamArt for moving this out into a callous world.”   
– Art Bergmann (July 22, 2022)

LYRICS

She walks these fields  
A hungry ghost  
Drinking in sunlight  
To overdose  
Kiss of the syringe  
Cuts through scars  
Glimpse of heaven?  
Cold night stars  
 
The people here can’t see  
Weather gone weird  
What they don’t understand  
They condemn in fear  
She smiles  
They demand her name  
“I’m the witch,  
You turned to flames”  
 
There is no crack  
That lets in the light  
There is no light  
To bridge this dark divide  
 
Grief is the prize  
If you stay alive  
 
“Let’s do it your way!”  
Our love hard ‘cri de coeur’  
Even when pariahs  
In our film without a score  
Anything less  
We kicked out the door  
“Weren’t you born,  
Love’s what we’re here for!”  
 
There is no crack  
That lets in the light  
There is no light  
To bridge this dark divide  
 
Grief is the prize  
If you stay alive  
 
So what can I give  
To finally relieve  
A song worth nothing  
That no one believes  
A love larger  
Than the national bore  
I’d kill the world bank  
For one second more  
 
There is no crack  
Let’s in the light  
There is no light  
To bridge this dark divide  
 
Grief is the prize  
If you’re left alive  
Always surprised  
If alive  
Grief is the prize  
When you wake  
 
She walks these fields  
She walks these fields  
She walks the sky  
Above the fire  
 
I wanna do it your way

>“And we're still together; it's a miracle that one of us didn't die or, you know, we didn't go down in a blaze of glory, like some people wanted us to.

>Sorry to wreck the ending but... you know...”
