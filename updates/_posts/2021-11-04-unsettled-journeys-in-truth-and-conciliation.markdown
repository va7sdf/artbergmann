Anyone who thought the Order of Canada would tame Art Bergmann was wrong. Deeply wrong. The singer-songwriter is as biting and anti-establishment as ever, demonstrated by his latest album, Late Stage Dementia Empire, and his unflinching opinions on his country’s failings. Jessica and George talk with the veteran of Canada’s music scene about residential schools, music, allyship, colonialism, and more.

And there’s lots of music to puncutate the conversation—who needs commas when you’ve got rock ‘n’ roll?
